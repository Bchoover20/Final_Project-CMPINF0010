## Description:

This is a repository for the final project in CMPINF 0010 - Big Ideas in Computing and Information. The goal is to build upon the Big Ideas we have learned throughout the year and fuse our newfound coding skills into a professional project that answers the question "What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?"

Our coding language was Python and we used SQL queries and pandas + matplot primarily to work with the data from wprdc.
